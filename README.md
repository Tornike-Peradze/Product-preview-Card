## Overview

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). It aims to create a visually appealing and visually as close as possible to the original order summary component.

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a product preview card component that showcases a perfume with a visually appealing design and responsive layout. The goal was to accurately represent the product information and provide an interactive user experience.

Key Requirements

- Display the perfume image, product name, description, and pricing information.
- Apply appropriate styles to achieve a clean and modern design.
- Implement hover effects for interactive elements.
- Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes and devices.

Solution
To meet the challenge requirements, the following steps were taken:

- Semantic HTML Markup: The HTML structure was designed using semantic elements to ensure proper accessibility and search engine optimization.

- CSS Styling: Custom CSS styles were applied to achieve the desired visual design. Techniques such as positioning, sizing, and border-radius were utilized to create a visually appealing layout. Custom fonts were also applied to enhance typography.

- Responsive Design: Media queries and relative units were used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures that the product preview card displays correctly on various devices, providing an optimal user experience.

- Hover Effects: Interactive elements such as the "Add to Cart" button and the pricing information were given hover effects to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and elements of the web page.
  CSS: Applied styles to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the order summary card.
- Visual Studio Code: A powerful and popular code editor that provided a convenient and efficient development environment.
- Frontend Mentor: The project was completed as part of a challenge provided by Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor offers a range of real-life coding challenges to help developers practice their skills and improve their front-end development abilities.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here are some key things I learned:

- Utilizing flexbox: I deepened my understanding of flexbox and its powerful capabilities for creating responsive layouts. I applied flexbox to achieve proper alignment and spacing of elements within the card component.

- Managing div relationships: I learned how to structure and organize div elements to establish the desired relationships between different sections of the card component. This allowed me to create a logical hierarchy and improve the overall structure of the HTML code.

- CSS Positioning: Leveraging CSS positioning properties such as absolute and relative, you were able to precisely position elements within the card. This technique allowed you to create the overlay effect for the music icon and position the "Change" text and price information appropriately.

### Continued development

I aspire to dive deeper into CSS and explore more advanced techniques and concepts. This includes mastering CSS Grid, learning CSS animations and transitions, and exploring responsive design patterns to create truly dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's crucial to create websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I want to focus on mastering responsive design principles and adopting a mobile-first approach, ensuring that my projects are accessible and provide a great user experience across all devices.
